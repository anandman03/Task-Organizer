## Flight Manual

The following is a minor walkthrough containing a set of examples on how to use task-organizer.

### Create Task

To create a new task use the `--task`/`-t` option with your task's description following right after. There are two optional arguements `b:<board-name>` and `p:<priority>`. By default board name is `Default` and priority is 3.

```
$ organize -t Improve documentation
$ organize -t Improve documentation b:coding p:2

```

### Create Note

To create a new note use the `--note`/`-n` option with your note's body following right after. There are two optional arguements `b:<board-name>` and `p:<priority>`. By default board name is `Default` and priority is 3.

```
$ organize -n Mergesort worse-case O(nlogn)
$ organize -n Mergesort worse-case O(nlogn) b:college p:2
```

### Remove Item

To delete an item, use the `--remove`/`-r` options followed by the id of the target items. Duplicate ids are automatically filtered out.

```
$ organize -r 2
```

### Done Task

To mark a task as complete/incomplete, use the `--done`/`-d` option followed by the id of the target task. Note that the option will update to its opposite the `complete` status of the given tasks, thus checking a complete task will render it as pending and a pending task as complete. Duplicate ids are automatically filtered out.

```
$ organize -d 1
```

### Set Priority

To set a priority level for a task while initializing it, include id and the `p:x` syntax in the task's description, where x can be an integer of value `1`, `2` or `3`. Note that all tasks by default are created with a normal priority - `3`.

- `3` - Normal priority
- `2` - Medium priority
- `1` - High priority

```
$ organize -p 1 p:3
```

### Change Boards

To change the name of the board, use the `--board/-b` option follwed by `c:x`, where x is the board name to be changed and then `n:y`, where y is the new name of the board.

```
$ organize -b c:coding n:college
```

### Edit Item

To change the description of an item, use the `--edit/-e` option follwed by the id of the target task and new description to be assigned.

```
$ organize -e 2 New task description
```

### Move Item

To move an item to another boards, use the `--move`/`-m` option, followed by the target item id, prefixed by the `b:` symbol, and the name of the destination board. The default board `Default` can be accessed through the `default` keyword.

```
$ organize -m 1 myboard reviews
```

### Star Item

To mark an item as favorite, use the `--star`/`-s` option followed by the id of the target item. The functionality of this option is the same as the one of the above described `--done` option.

```
$ organize -s 1
```

### Copy Item Description

To copy to your system's clipboard the description of one or more items, use the `--copy`/`-y` option followed by the ids of the target items. Note that the option will also include the newline character as a separator to each pair of adjacent copied descriptions, thus resulting in a clear and readable stack of sentences on paste.

```
$ organize -c 1 2 3
```

### Delete Marked Done Tasks

To delete/clear all complete tasks at once across all boards, use the `--unpin`/`-u` option.

```
$ organize --unpin
```

### Display Timeline

In order to display all items in a timeline view, based on their creation date, the `--timeline` option can be used.

```
$ organize --timeline
```

### Begin Task

To mark a task as started/paused, use the `--begin`/`-b` option followed by the id of the target task. The functionality of this option is the same as the one of the above described `--check` option.

```
$ organize -b 2
```

### List Items

To list a group of items where each item complies with a specific set of attributes, use the `--list`/`-l` option followed by the desired attributes. Board names along with item traits can be considered valid listing attributes. For example to list all pending tasks, the following could be used. The available attributes are `pending/in-process/done/notes`.

```
$ organize -l pending
```

### Find Items

To find for task/board, use the `--find`/`-f` option, followed by id of the task or name of the board.

```
$ organize -l coding
```

### Erase Items

To remove all the elements and boards use `--erase`.

```
$ organize --erase
```

### Add Bookmark

To create a new bookmark use the `--mark` option with bookmark's link followed by name of the bookmark.

```
$ organize --mark https://www.npmjs.com npm
```

### Remove Bookmark

To remove a bookmark use the `--unmark` option with bookmark's name.

```
$ organize --unmark npm
```

### Copy Bookmark

To copy a bookmark use the `--get` option with bookmark's name.

```
$ organize --get npm
```

### Display Bookmarks

To display all bookmarks use the `--bookmarks` option. All the names along with links will be displayed.

```
$ organize --bookmarks
```
